# Chain Pop

A minimalist extraction-based logic puzzle game built with Flutter + Flame.

---

## Gameplay

Each level presents a grid of nodes with directional arrows. Tap a node to extract it — but only if its path (in the arrow's direction) is clear. Tap in the wrong order and the node will jam. Clear the board to win.

## Level Generation System

### Overview

All levels are generated procedurally using the **backward-generation algorithm**, which guarantees every puzzle is solvable by construction.

### Algorithm

1. **Select positions** — Pick N unique random positions on the grid.
2. **Define solution order** — Shuffle positions to create the removal sequence. Index 0 = first node the player taps; index N-1 = last.
3. **Assign directions** — For each node at index `i`, only nodes at `i+1..N-1` are still on the board. Assign a direction whose ray does **not** pass through any of those "future" nodes.
4. **Validate** — Run `LevelValidator` as a double-safety net.
5. **Fallback** — If all retries fail, return a guaranteed-solvable diagonal layout.

Because every direction is chosen to avoid future nodes, no deadlock can ever occur.

### Difficulty Modes

| Mode   | Grid Size  | Nodes    | Density | Chain Length | Auto levels |
|--------|-----------|----------|---------|--------------|------------|
| Easy   | 4×4–6×6   | 4–12     | 25%     | 2–4          | 0–9        |
| Medium | 6×6–10×10 | 10–30    | 45%     | 3–6          | 10–29      |
| Hard   | 10×10–20×20 | 25–100 | 65%     | 5–10         | 30+        |

### Usage

```dart
import 'package:chain_pop/game/levels/generation/generation.dart';

final generator = LevelGenerator();

// Auto-derive difficulty from level ID (level 15 → medium)
final result = generator.generate(15);

// Explicit difficulty mode
final easyResult = generator.generate(50, mode: DifficultyMode.easy);
final hardResult = generator.generate(5, mode: DifficultyMode.hard);

if (result.isSuccess) {
  final level = result.value; // LevelData
} else {
  print('Error: ${result.error}');
}
```

### LevelManager (game-side API)

```dart
import 'package:chain_pop/game/levels/level_manager.dart';

// Always returns a valid LevelData — handles errors internally
final level = LevelManager.getLevel(levelId);

// With explicit difficulty
final hardLevel = LevelManager.getLevel(levelId, mode: DifficultyMode.hard);
```

## Running Tests

```bash
# All tests
flutter test

# By category
flutter test test/deadlock_test.dart                    # 1000-level deadlock check
flutter test test/regression_test.dart                  # Level 1-5 playthroughs
flutter test test/game/levels/generation/               # All generation tests

# Performance benchmarks
flutter test test/game/levels/generation/level_generator_performance_test.dart --reporter expanded
```

### Performance Requirements

| Level Size    | Limit  |
|--------------|--------|
| ≤50 nodes    | 100 ms |
| ≤100 nodes   | 500 ms |
| ≤400 nodes   | 2000 ms|
